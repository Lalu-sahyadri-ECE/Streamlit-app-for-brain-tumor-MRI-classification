# 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Classification Web App

This is a Streamlit-based web app that uses a deep learning model to classify brain MRI scans into four categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

The app lets users upload an MRI image and instantly see a predicted tumor type using a trained CNN model.
